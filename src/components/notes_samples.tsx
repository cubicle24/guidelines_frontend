Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**4-/2174**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified
left
main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The
left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion.
2. LV ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug
eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher).
.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2174-5-20**] demonstrated:The left
atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise
with a prominent anterior fat pad.
.
[**6-6**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left
bundle-branch block.
Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2174-6-4**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise,
no major
change.
.
CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving
pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen.
.
Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **]
with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears
fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained
difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor
urine output.
- Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  Were held
initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her
admission.
- Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial
of lasix proved successful.  She will now go home on 160 mg PO
daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], her nephrologist.
She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition
consult during stay.
.
# CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p
recent LCx stent.  She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix,
and Losartan.

.
#. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty
[**2174-5-11**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family:
per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr.
[**Name (NI) 137**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve
replacment due to "calcifications." Patient may be candidate for
new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last
[**Name (NI) 113**].  Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge.
.
# Respiratory distress resolved -
Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial
secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by
elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram
stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight
while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents
resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only
given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started
[**5-29**], continued for 7 days.  She will continue lasix as
outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema.
.
# ANEMIA/GIB:
HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if
represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**5-31**] and this
demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely
representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and
haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal
limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u
PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since.
Her Hcts were between 26 and 28.  Stools were checked for guiac,
and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  We discharged her
home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to
continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss.  She is not
actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts.  We also
recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  Although, she needs to be
very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid
shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr):
Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to
hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been
initiated on HD in [**2174-3-15**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to
admission. Volume overload/CHF on admission, improved with UF,
now appears euvolemic. Creatinine 1.... on discharge.  Pt has
history of RCC with nephrectomy.  Renal function has seemed to
normalize.  Will continue follow up with nephrologist and he
will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter.

#  Pt was discharge to home with services for PT and home health
care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
1. Respiratory Failure
2. CHF
3. Renal Failure

Secondary Diagnoses:
1. Aortic Stenosis
2. Anemia
3. HTN


Discharge Condition:
Stable, afebrile, pt walking with a walker, eating on her own,
with a normal mental status.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your
lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  You
were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on
your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with
diuretics.  We also are continuing to give you the medicines
carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off
your lungs.

In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission.
Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].  You also have a dialysis catheter in
your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an
outpatient.

We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  You should
meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy.  Make sure
to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the
bowel preparation they plan for you.

Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight >
3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  Call the nutritionist with any
questions.

Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest
pain, dizziness or fainting or any other worrisome symptoms, do
not hesitate to call your doctor or call 911 in case of
emergency.

Psych Consult - Depression 

Description: Psychiatric Consultation of patient with recurring depression.

CC: "Five years ago, I stopped drinking and since that time, I have had severe depression. I was doing okay when I stopped my medications in April for a few weeks, but then I got depressed again. I started lithium three weeks ago."

HPI: The patient is a 45-year-old married white female without children currently working as a billing analyst for Northwest Natural. The patient has had one psychiatric hospitalization for seven days in April of 1999. The patient now presents with recurrent depressive symptoms for approximately four months. The patient states that she has decreased energy, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, feelings of guilt, feelings of extreme anger, psychomotor agitation, and increased appetite. The patient states her sleep is normal and her ability to concentrate is normal. The patient states that last night she had an argument with her husband in which he threaten to divorce her. The patient went into the rest room, tried to find a razor blade, could not find one but instead found a scissor and cut her arm moderately with some moderate depth. She felt better after doing so and put a bandage over the wound and did not report to her husband or anybody else what she had done. The patient reports that she has had increased tension with her husband as of recent. She notes that approximately a week ago she struck her husband several times. She states that he has never hit her but instead pushed her back after she was hitting him. She reports no history of abuse in the past. The patient identifies recent stressors as having ongoing conflict at work with her administrator with them "cracking down on me." The patient also notes that her longstanding therapy will be temporarily interrupted by the therapist having a child. She states that her recent depression seems to coincide with her growing knowledge that her therapist was pregnant. The patient states that she has a tremendous amount of anger towards her therapist for discontinuing or postponing treatment. She states that she feels "abandoned." The patient notes that it does raise issues with her past, where she had a child at the age of 17 who she gave away for adoption and a second child that she was pregnant by the age of 42 that she aborted at the request of her husband. The patient states she saw her therapist most recently last Friday. She sees the therapy weekly and indicates the therapy helps, although she is unable to specify how. When asked for specifics of what she has learned from the therapy, the patient was unable to reply. It appears that she is very concrete and has difficulty with symbolization and abstractions and self-observation. The patient reports that at her last visit her therapist was concerned that she may be suicidal and was considering hospitalization. The patient, at that point, stated that she would be safe through Monday despite having made a gesture last night. At present, the patient's mood is reactive and for much of the session she appears angry and irritated with me but at the end of the session, after I have given her my assessment, she appears calmed and not depressed. When asked if she is suicidal at present, she states no. The patient does not want to go into the hospital. The patient also indicates at the end of the session she felt hopeful. The patient reports her current sleep is about eight hours per night. She states that longest she has been able to stay awake in the past has been 24 hours. She states that during periods where she feels up she sleeps perhaps six hours per night. The patient reports no spending sprees and no reports no sexual indiscretions. The patient states that her sexuality does increase when she is feeling better but not enormously so. The patient denies any history of delusions or hallucinations. The patient denies any psychosis. The patient states that she does have mood swings and that the upstate lasts for a couple of weeks at longest. She states that more predominately she has depression. The patient states that she does not engage in numerous projects when she is in an upstate although does imagine doing so. The patient notes that suicidality and depression seems to often arise around disputes with her husband and/or feelings of abandonment. The patient indicates some satisfaction when she is called on her behavior "I need to answer for my actions." The patient gives a substantial history of alcohol abuse lasting up to about five years ago when she was hospitalized. Most typically, the patient will drink at least a bottle of wine per day. The patient has attended AA but at present going once a week, although she states that she is not engaged as she has been in the past; and when asked if she may be in early relapse, she indicates that yes that is a very real possibility. The patient states she is not working through any of the steps at present.

PPH: The patient denies any sexual abuse as a child. She states that she was disciplined primarily by her father with spankings. She states that on occasion her mother would use a belt to spank her or with her hand or with a spoon. The patient has been seeing Dr. A for the past five years. Prior to that she was admitted to a hospital for her suicide attempt. The patient also has one short treatment experienced with the Day Treatment Program here in Portland. The patient states that it was not useful as it focused on group work with pts that she did not feel any similarity with. The patient, also as a child, had a history of cutting behaviors. The patient was admitted to the hospital after lacerating her arm.

MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has hypothyroidism and last had her TSH drawn a week ago but does not know the results. Janet Green is her primary physician. The patient also has had herniated disc in the neck and a sinus inflammation, both of which were treated surgically.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: The patient currently is taking Synthroid 75 mcg per day and lithium 1200 mg p.o. q.d. The patient started the lithium approximately three weeks ago and has not had a recent lithium level or kidney function test.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

SUBSTANCE HISTORY: The patient has been sober for five years. She drank one bottle of wine per day as per HPI. History of drinking for approximately 25 years. The patient does not currently have a sponsor. The patient experimented with amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana approximately 16 years ago.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's mother is age 66, father is age 70, and she has a brother age 44. Her brother has been incarcerated numerous times for assaults and has difficulty with anger and rage. He made a suicide attempt at age 17. The patient's father is a machinist who she describes as somewhat narcissistic and with alcohol abuse problem. He also has arthritis. The patient's mother is arthritic. She states that her mother stopped working at middle age after being laid off and appears somewhat reclusive.

EDUCATIONAL HISTORY: The patient was educated through high school and has two years of Night College. The patient states that she grew up and was raised in Portland but notes her childhood was primarily lonely. She states she was unliked and unpopular child because she was "shy" and "not smart enough." The patient denies having secrets. The patient reports that this is her second marriage, which has lasted two years. Her first marriage lasted I believe it was five years. The patient also had a relationship in recovery for four years, which ended after they went "different directions."

MSE: The patient is middle-aged white female, dressed in a red sweater with a white shirt, full patterned skirt, and open sandals. The patient is suspicious and somewhat confrontative early in the session. She asked me regarding my cancellation policy, why I require seven days and not 24 hours. The patient also is irritated with paper required of her. Psychomotor is increased slightly. The patient makes strong eye contact. Speech is normal rate, rhythm, and volume. Mood is "irritated." Affect is irritated, angry, demanding, attempting to wrest control from me, depressed, frustrated. Thought is directed. Content is nondelusional. There are no auditory and no visual hallucinations. The patient has no homicidal ideation. The patient does endorse suicidal ideations. Regarding plan, the patient notes that cutting herself hurts too much therefore she would like to take some benzodiazepines or barbiturates but has access to none. The patient states that she will not try to hurt herself currently and that she poses no risk at present. The patient notes that she does not want to go to the hospital at present. The patient is alert and oriented x 3. Recall is three for three at five minutes. Proverbs are concrete. She has fair impulse control, poor judgment, and poor insight.

FORMULATION: The patient is a 45-year-old married white female with no children now presenting with recurrent depressive symptoms and active suicidal ideation and planning. The patient reports longstanding depressive symptoms that were subthreshold punctuated by periods of more severe depression. The patient also reports some up periods, which do not meet most criteria for a bipolar disorder or manic states. The patient notes that current depression started with approximately the same time that she became aware that her therapist was pregnant. She notes that the current depression is atypical in that it is primarily anger based and she does not have the typical hypersomnia that she gets. The patient reports being unable to express anger to her therapist and being unable to discuss her feeling regarding the pregnancy. The patient also states that she feels abandoned with the upcoming discontinuation of treatment while the therapist is giving birth and thereafter. Symptoms are consistent with a longstanding dysthymia and reoccurring depression. In addition, diagnosis is highly complicated by presence of a strong personality disorder component, most likely borderline personality disorder. This latter diagnosis seems to be the most active at this time with the patient acutely reacting to perceived therapist's absence and departure. This is exacerbated by instability in the patient's marital life.

DIAGNOSIS:
Axis I: Dysthymia. Major depression, moderate severity, recurrent, with partial remission.
Axis II: Borderline personality disorder.
Axis III: Hypothyroidism and cervical disc herniation and sinus surgery.
Axis IV: Medical access. Marital discord.
Axis V: A GAF of 30.

PLAN: The patient is unlikely to have bipolar disorder. We will recommend the patient's thyroid be rechecked to ensure she is currently euthymic. We would recommend continued weekly or twice weekly insight oriented psychotherapy with aggressive exploration of the patient's reaction to her therapist's departure. We would also recommend dialectical behavioral therapy while the therapist is on leave. We would recommend continued treatment with SSRIs for dysthymia and depression. We would suggest prescribing long acting antidepressant such as Prozac, given the patient's ambivalence regarding medications. Prozac should be pushed to minimum of 40 mg, which the patient has already tolerated in the past, but most likely up to 60 or 80 mg. We might also supplement the Prozac with a (anti-sleep medication).

Time spent with the patient was 1.5 hours.`



const er_report = `REASON FOR ADMISSION: Hepatic encephalopathy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old Native American male with known alcohol cirrhosis who presented to the emergency room after an accidental fall in the bathroom. He said that he was doing fine prior to that and denied having any complaints. He was sitting watching TV and he felt sleepy. So, he went to the bathroom to urinate before going to bed and while he was trying to lift the seat, he tripped and fell and hit his head on the back. His head hit the toilet seat. Then, he started having bleeding and had pain in the area with headache. He did not lose consciousness as far as he can tell. He went and woke up his sister. This happened somewhere between 10:30 and 11 p.m. His sister brought a towel and covered the laceration on the back of his head and called EMS, who came to his house and brought him to the emergency room, where he was found to have a laceration on the back of his head, which was stapled and a CT of the head was obtained and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology. On his lab work, his ammonia was found to be markedly elevated at 106. So, he is being admitted for management of this. He denied having any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. He said he has been taking his medicines, but he could not recall those. He denied having any symptoms prior to this fall. He said earlier today he also fell. He also said that this was an accidental fall caused by problem with his walker. He landed on his back at that time, but did not have any back pain afterwards.  Of note, the patient relies on his sister to understand his health because he only finished junior high.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

The skull is unremarkable except for the surgery changes. No acute abnormalities overall.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy. Trigger is unclear at this time. Could be noncompliance. No evidence of GI bleed and his electrolytes are normal. I am not sure if he is taking any sedatives, as he does not recall the medication that he is on. The patient will be admitted to the hospital for management. He will be started on lactulose. I will give him 30 mL every two hours until he has a bowel movement. Then, we will adjust the dose to target three bowel movements daily and we will monitor his ammonia level and ensure that it is trending down. We will monitor his electrolyte and correct as needed and I will hydrate him, as hypovolemia is also a possible trigger. We will obtain an ultrasound of his abdomen to see if there is any ascites. At this time, there is no clinical evidence of SBP, but if he develops any fever may consider tapping his belly if there is ascites to rule out that possibility.
2. Thrombocytopenia likely due to cirrhosis. We will monitor the level. No need for transfusion at this time.
3. Macrocytosis also due to liver disease. I will check his vitamin levels, however, to ensure that he does not need any supplementation.
4. History of diabetes as per the patient. His glucose is 105. This can be clarified in the morning with his primary care physician. We will monitor his glucose for now.
5. Skull laceration. This was stapled by the ER physician and we will watch it for now, appear to be stable. No evidence of any other trauma.
6. We will watch him on the telemetry floor to ensure that he has no arrhythmias leading to his two falls, which appear to be incidental as per the patient.
7. Right-sided hemiparesis appear to be chronic and not an acute issue. The patient already has a walker at home.
8. We can try to obtain more information in the morning about his past medical history, medication, etc., from his family and/or his primary care physician at Sacaton.

Time spent in evaluation and management of this patient in the emergency room exceeds 70 minutes.`

PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. T was born in Dwyne, Missouri, with no complications associated with his birth. Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age. When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather. He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on. He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.

Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old. He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company. He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years. Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993. He has a son who is currently 20 years old.

Mental Status Exam: Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense. At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor. There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement. His speech was clear, concise, but pressured. His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger. There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation. His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability. At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview. There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations. There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations. Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought. There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking. There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts. There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs. His intelligence was average. His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility. He was oriented to time, place, person and situation. There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation. His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.

He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence. There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches. His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans. Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem. His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments. He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.

There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation. His credibility seemed good. There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence. The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication. The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation. His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral. There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.

IMPRESSIONS: Major Depressive Disorder, single episode

RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy. At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment. Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year. As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning. Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.`
